"""Hotfix regression test for GitHub #79 (UnLuckyLust, hhkbble).

Background: v3.2.16 added an "additive write" branch to
``build_iteminfo_intent_change`` that, when ``_resolve_field_name``
returned None, fell through with ``target_field = intent.field`` if
the field name was in ``SUPPORTED_FIELDS``. The intent was a
mod that adds enchants to records like Axiom Bracelet which have
no enchants in vanilla.

The fix was a half-fix: the writer accepted the new key on the
parsed dict, but the native parser's serializer ``_write_item``
walks a fixed ``_ITEM_FIELDS`` schema that does NOT include
``enchant_data_list`` (the live binary's EnchantData layout has
not been reverse-engineered). The added key was silently dropped
at serialise time, ``new_bytes == vanilla_body`` was True, and
``build_iteminfo_intent_change`` returned None, which the apply
pipeline reported to the user as "0 byte changes".

UnLuckyLust on GitHub #79 confirmed v3.2.16 still produced "0
byte changes" against a mod that adds buffs to Axiom Bracelet
(key=1001129).

Honest hotfix: drop ``enchant_data_list`` from ``SUPPORTED_FIELDS``
(adding it back is gated on real schema work) and have the writer
log a clear, user-actionable skip reason that names the
unsupported field, so the user knows why their intent was dropped
instead of being told "0 byte changes" with no context.

These tests pin that contract.
